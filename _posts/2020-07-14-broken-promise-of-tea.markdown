There's a sort of broken promise in a cup of tea.

On the face of it, tea *should* be one of my favorite vices, sitting at the intersection of the nu-occultism I find myself circling around and the perennial quest for health and weight loss. Tea packaging can range from sleek, modern satchels with promises like "Sleep" and "Youth" stamped across in promienent text, all the way to loose herbs and flowers gathered in a sandwich baggie with a hand-written label humbly describing the ingredients.

Preparing the tea has the same ritual satisfaction as my formerly-beloved coffee, or a quick morning shower. The process is brimming with an abundance of choice: pulling out the mug that catches my eye, running my finger over the haphazard collection of blends wondering which might best soothe my current malaise. Filling the mug with hot water and watching the water bloomjust by being in contact with the tea bag evokes a memory from a past life as an apothecary from ages past; asking nature to provide a balance for the bodily humors as well as to provide a treatment for insomnia that won't leave on dependent or sleepwalking.

And yet, when the steeping's done, the bag's discarded, and the first few sips are gingerly taken, there is a sense of disappointment. No great transformation takes place; the platitudes and promises printed on the side of the box are revealed to be marketing, and particularly shallow marketing at that. The magic built up in the preparation is stripped away, leaving a substance that functions as both a bad refreshment and a bad remedy.

Maybe I am asking too much from tea. Mayube the value is in how it grounds one to the earth while drinking. And yet, to listen to proponents of tea, you'd think they had discovered a wondrous panacea to all of their worldly woes. But what I find is a drink that is too easily forgotten, half-finished until I need the mug for other, more quenching pursuits.
